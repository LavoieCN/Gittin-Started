# My Favorite Movie

  I have a hard time picking a favorite movie, and it's something that is constantly changing. However, at the moment
I would have to say that my favorite movie is 2000's '*The Patriot*', written by **Robert Rodat** and released in 2000. As you may know, the main
character of '*The Patriot*' is none other than;

### Mel Gibson

  Obviously there are some other notable figures starring in this movie, but *let's be honest*, **Gibson** is the star
of the show.

  I'm a big fan of history, especially **American** history, and movies such as this one draw my attention like no other.
Obviously it's not *completely* historically accurate, but it bases it's contents off of several different real-life
individuals during the time of the Revolutionary War. That, and a movie with Mel Gibson playing as a southern war hero
was bound to be good.
